      <description>Making BetsBeing around sports and specifically sports betting I often see what many people call the Gambler’s fallacy. A common example of this is given by the following thought experiment:
Say somone flips a coin 99 times all landing on heads, but says the coin is fair. Then asks what are the odds of getting tails on my next toss?
Commiting the Gambler’s fallacy would be to say that it is more likely to land tails because it is due.</description>

      <description>Do PGA Golfers Preform Better in Different Regions or Rounds?Many times I hear either on TV or through friends that X golfer preforms better in round 4 or that X golfer seems to play better in the south. Intuitively I can see the case for both, some golfers may preform better on a given round due to their mindset. It is even easier to understand that players may play better in a given region, due to being in an area they are comfortable with or grew up and where they are more familiar with the typical layouts of courses or the grass of the course so lets look into it.</description>

      <description>In my free time I spend much of my time playing Overwatch or trying to learn the game. I really enjoy the game and looked into how I could get some stats to find improvements in my game and maybe others as well. There are and were a few problems that I encountered when doing some research on this topic.
Major IssuesThe APIs that were available were mediocreThe stats available are agregrated vice individual stats for each gameNo easy way that I know of to get lots of player’s statsThe first issue I was able to solve by creating a scraper.</description>

      <title>Creating Golf Scores Database</title>

      <description>The goal of this post is to create a database with all the scores recorded on golf tours. ESPN holds all the scorecards of players for each tournament dating back to 2001.
We are going to start out by exploring around the ESPN website to find out how the data is stored and a way to scrape the data into R and then we are going to export this big data to SQL.</description>

      <title>Scraping PGA Site</title>

      <description>To begin we want to use the json data from the PGA tour website. After doing some investigation into the PGA tour website, there are both pros and cons of using it for scraping.
From what I have found we will only be able to get shot data from 2014 and beyond. This will contain any data we would want but only goes back to 2014, before 2014 there isn’t even data for simple scorecards for players.</description>

      <description>In this post I will create word clouds to help determine what may or may not be important in predicting PGA golfers performance. I will start with gathering data from the PGA tour website.

In this example I will be using descriptions from TPC Sawgrass golf course which hosts the Players Championship every year and is one of the most iconic course in the game. The hole descriptions in website format can be found here.</description>
