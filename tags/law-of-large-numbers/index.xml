      <description>Making BetsBeing around sports and specifically sports betting I often see what many people call the Gambler’s fallacy. A common example of this is given by the following thought experiment:
Say somone flips a coin 99 times all landing on heads, but says the coin is fair. Then asks what are the odds of getting tails on my next toss?
Commiting the Gambler’s fallacy would be to say that it is more likely to land tails because it is due.</description>
