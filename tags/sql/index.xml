      <description>The goal of this post is to create a database with all the scores recorded on golf tours. ESPN holds all the scorecards of players for each tournament dating back to 2001.
We are going to start out by exploring around the ESPN website to find out how the data is stored and a way to scrape the data into R and then we are going to export this big data to SQL.</description>
